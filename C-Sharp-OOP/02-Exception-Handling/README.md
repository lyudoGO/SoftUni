Exception Handling Homework

Problem 1.Square Root            
Write a program that reads an integer number and calculates and prints its square root. 
If the number is invalid or negative, print "Invalid number". In all cases finally print "Good bye". Use try-catch-finally.

Problem 2.Enter Numbers             
Write a method ReadNumber(int start, int end) that enters an integer number in given range [start…end].

If the user enters an invalid number, let the user to enter again.
