Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. 
SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language, is a standardized computer language that was originally developed by IBM for querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative statements. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements. 
These additional features make Transact-SQL Turing complete.[citation needed]

Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.

Transact-SQL provides the following statements to declare and set local variables: DECLARE, SET and SELECT.

Keywords for flow control in Transact-SQL include BEGIN and END, BREAK, CONTINUE, GOTO, IF and ELSE, RETURN, WAITFOR, and WHILE.
BEGIN and END mark a block of statements.
BREAK ends the enclosing WHILE loop, while CONTINUE causes the next iteration of the loop to execute.
WAITFOR will wait for a given amount of time, or until a particular time of day. The statement can be used for delays or to block execution until the set time.
RETURN is used to immediately return from a stored procedure or function.
IF and ELSE allow conditional execution.
