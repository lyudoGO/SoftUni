Homework Functions and Function Expressions 

Problem 1.Function Playground
Create a function with no parameters. Perform the following operations:       
  •	The function should print the number of its arguments and each of the arguments' type.                    
    o	Call the function with different number and type of arguments.                
  •	The function should print the this object. Compare the results when calling the function from:          
    o	Global scope                                        
    o	Function scope                                            
    o	Over the object                                         
    o	Use call and apply to call the function with parameters and without parameters                      
    
Problem 2.DOM Traversal                           
You are given an HTML file. Write a function that traverses all child elements of an element by a 
given CSS selector and prints all found elements in the format:                                                                               Element name: id="<id>", class="<class>"                                                            
Print each element on a new line. Indent child elements.   

Problem 3.	DOM Manipulation                        
Create an IIFE module for working with the DOM tree. The module should support the following operations:                
    •	Adding а DOM element to a parent element specified by selector                              
    •	Removing a child element from a parent specified by selector                          
    •	Attaching an event to a given selector by given event type and event hander                             
    •	Retrieving elements by a given CSS selector                                   
The module should reveal only its methods (i.e. everything else should be encapsulated).                  

Problem 4.	Console Module                        
Create a module for working with the console object. The module should support the following functionality:                 
      •	Writing a line to the console                           
      •	Writing a line to the console using formatting (with placeholders)                        
      •	Writing to the console should call toString() to each element                         
      •	Writing errors and warnings to the console with and without format
