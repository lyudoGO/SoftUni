Donation

A donation is a gift given by physical or legal persons, typically for charitable purposes and/or to benefit a cause. 
A donation may take various forms, including cash offering, services, new or used goods including clothing, toys, 
food, and vehicles. It also may consist of emergency, relief or humanitarian aid items, development aid support, 
and can also relate to medical care needs as i.e. blood or organs for transplant. Charitable gifts of goods or 
services are also called gifts in kind.
