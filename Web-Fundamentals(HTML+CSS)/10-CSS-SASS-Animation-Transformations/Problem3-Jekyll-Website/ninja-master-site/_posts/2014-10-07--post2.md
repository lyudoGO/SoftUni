Assassination

The best-known cases of assassination attempts involve famous historical figures. 
Deaths of famous persons have sometimes been attributed to assassination by ninja, 
but the secretive natures of these scenarios have been difficult to prove.
Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but there is no evidence to prove 
whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.
The warlord Oda Nobunaga's notorious reputation led to several attempts on his life.
In 1571, a Koga ninja and sharpshooter by the name of Sugitani Zenjubo was hired to 
assassinate Nobunaga. Using two arquebuses, he fired two consecutive shots at Nobunaga, 
but was unable to inflict mortal injury through Nobunaga's armor.
Sugitani managed to escape, but was caught four years later and put to death by torture.
In 1573, Manabe Rokuro, a vassal of daimyo Hatano Hideharu, attempted to infiltrate Azuchi Castle
and assassinate the sleeping Nobunaga. However, this also ended in failure, 
and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public.
According to a document, the Iranki, when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province ? which his army 
had devastated ? a group of three ninja shot at him with large-caliber firearms. 
The shots flew wide of Nobunaga, however, and instead killed seven of his surrounding companions.
