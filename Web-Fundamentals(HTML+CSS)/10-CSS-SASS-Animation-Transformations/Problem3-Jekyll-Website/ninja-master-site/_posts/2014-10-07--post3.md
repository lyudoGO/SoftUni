Training

The skills required of the ninja has come to be known in modern times as ninjutsu , 
but it is unlikely they were previously named under a single discipline, but were rather 
distributed among a variety of covered espionage and survival skills.
The first specialized training began in the mid-15th century, when certain samurai families 
started to focus on covert warfare, including espionage and assassination.
Like the samurai, ninja were born into the profession, where traditions were kept in, 
and passed down through the family.According to Turnbull, the ninja was trained from childhood, 
as was also common in samurai families. Outside the expected martial art disciplines, 
a youth studied survival and scouting techniques, as well as information regarding poisons and explosives.
Physical training was also important, which involved long distance runs, climbing, 
stealth methods of walking and swimming.A certain degree of knowledge regarding common 
professions was also required if one was expected to take their form in disguise.
Some evidence of medical training can be derived from one account, where an Iga ninja provided 
first-aid to Ii Naomasa, who was injured by gunfire in the Battle of Sekigahara. 
Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a "black medicine" meant to stop bleeding.
